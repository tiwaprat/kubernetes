In this project we will use previously created cluster (kubeadm_cluster_setup.txt) and deploy a simple nginx image and access it using NodePort. 
Steps: 
1. setup sg for master and worker node so that both the nodes are pingable from each other. 
2. run : kubectl run mypod --image nginx 
3. incase this pod runs on workernode. try to access curl http://<pod ip> from worker node it should be accessible using cn0 interface 
   But this same pod (on worker node) will not be accessible from masternode not even pingable as this pod ip on worker node is only accessible through flannel.1 ineterface 
   from master that to from a pod on master not from host it self.

[ Explaination: this is an example

   Pods are connected to the cni0 bridge.
   The flannel.1 overlay interface is available inside the network namespace used by Pods.
   So when a Pod on master node tries to reach 10.244.1.3, it:
   Uses cni0 → flannel.1 → encapsulates packet → sends to worker node → Flannel decapsulates → delivers to Pod.

  That’s why inter-Pod communication works, but host-to-Pod across nodes fails unless routed correctly.
   [ Master Host (172.31.82.239) ]          [ Worker Host (172.31.83.12) ]
           |                                         |
        enX0                                     enX0
           |                                         |
       [flannel.1]                              [flannel.1]
           |                                         |
        cni0                                     cni0
           |                                         |
   Pod: 10.244.0.2                         Pod: 10.244.1.3
  Master host itself can’t talk to 10.244.1.3 because its traffic doesn't go through flannel.1.
  Pod on master (10.244.0.x) can.] 
4. Open all required ports in SG of Master and worker nodes 
5. On master nodes open 8472(for flannel) , 6443(api server), 10250 (for kubelet) and on worker open 10250, 30000-32767(nodeport). 8472(flannel cni). 
6. Check SG settings , open port using ss on nodes and ip route on each nodes. If we want master to pod(on worker node) communication
   we need to have routing for overlay network on flannel.1 interface. If we don't have not a big issue we just can access pod from node . we Can still access pod from pods
   provided pods do have routing in their own routing table set up by flannel. 
7. Create servive mypod-svc and use selctor to connect to mypod. 
8. Now use public ip of worker node and high port of service to access application from outside the cluster.
